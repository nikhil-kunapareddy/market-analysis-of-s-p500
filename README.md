# Introduction
This project is a part of DS5200 course requirement. The aim of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on the s&p 500 stock index and build predictive machine learning models using feature engineering. The proposed conclusion of this project is to comeup with a comprehensive comparative study of the models.

# Methodology
The proposed methodology of the project is to start by extracting all the relavant information from yahoo finance api. After the customary exploratory data analysis, few feature engineering procedures will be performed to make sure that the data is ready for a time series forecasting. Four different models, two based on moving avergaes, one utilizing prophet api and the last one a neural network are going to be built, evaluated and compared.
